					"When you create such an item, you can use any number of charges you want, giving the extradimensional space a volume of up to one 5-foot cube per charge used. The shape/structure of the area is up to you. When opened, the container or door opens straight into this extradimensional space. The walls, ground and ceiling inside take on the same appearance as the normal material of the item. If the container or door is closed while a creature is inside it, the exit is apparent to the creature, and it can push through it to force it open as long as it is not locked. If there is a lock, it is also present on the inside, and the creature can attempt to lockpick it. If barred shut some other way, the creature can attempt any ability check to break it that it would be able to do from the outside."
